# cs320
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
During cs320 we focused on Junit tests to test the code to ensure it was functional and reliable. This process tested each individual requirement that was specified by the client. Peer code reviews as well as regular updates can help make sure that the code is up to standards.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
It is important to make sure that you are properly informed of the client's requirements for the project. User stories can help make these needs clear. It is also important to get regular feedback and keep stakeholders informed of progress.
How do I approach designing software?
When designing software you should be well-informed of the end goal. Modular design can help with reusability throughout the project and can make testing easier. Security should be a top priority and ensure trust between you, the client, and the user.
